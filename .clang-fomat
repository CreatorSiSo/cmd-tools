# Clang-format for Blender, as describe in the Blender style guide:
# https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Doc/Code_Style
#
# NOTE: Not all Blender style rules are currently supported properly! Take care
# when using this (see below for details).
#
# To apply clang-format to a file, run
#
#   clang-format -i foo.cpp
#
# This will update the file in place.
#
# NOTE: At time of writing (10/30/2017) not all formatting can be made exactly
# like current Blender sources, so a few compromises are made:
#
#   1. Newline after : in switch statements: clang-format will put the { on
#      the same line. This is due to a limitation in clang-format; it does not
#      support adding the newline after cases in switch statements.
#   2. Nested preprocessor directives don't get proper indentation after the
#      '#'. See IndentPPDirectives, which is supported in clang-format from
#      LLVM6, but not LLVM5. It is included below but commented out.
#   3. Special case of { position on if statements where the condition covers
#      more than one line. clang-format is an all or nothing formatter in this
#      case; so unfortunately the case of
#
#      if (long_condition_here() ||
#          long_condition_here() ||
#          long_condition_here() ||
#          long_condition_here())
#      {
#          ...
#      }
#
#      will become
#
#      if (long_condition_here() ||
#          long_condition_here() ||
#          long_condition_here() ||
#          long_condition_here()) {
#          ...
#      }
#

# Configuration of clang-format
# =============================

# This causes parameters on continuations to stack after the open brace,
# instead of getting wrapped and indented.
#
#   like_this(parameter_one,
#             parameter_two,
#             parameter_three);
#
AlignAfterOpenBracket: Align

# Disallow short functions on one line; break them up.
AllowShortBlocksOnASingleLine: 'false'

# These two settings trigger stacking of parameters in most cases; this is
# easier to read and also makes diffs easier to read (since an added or removed
# parameter is obvious). For example, function calls will look like this:
#
#   like_this(parameter_one,
#             parameter_two,
#             parameter_three,
#             parameter_four,
#             parameter_five,
#             parameter_six);
#
# instead of this
#
#   like_this(parameter_one, parameter_two, parameter_three, parameter_four,
#             parameter_five, parameter_six);

# 120 is the Blender standard. However, 80 columns is generally preferred.
# Since 120 should be the exception, use a 80-column limit for clang format. If
# this needs to be different, then a developer has two choices: Either manually
# change the result of running clang-format, or introduce '// clang-format off'
# and '// clang format on' markers to disable clang-format for that section.

# Cause initializer lists to have one member initialized per line, in the case
# that all initializers can't fit on a single line.
ConstructorInitializerAllOnOneLineOrOnePerLine: 'true'

# Don't indent the : after a constructor. For example:
#
#   explicit foo_class ()
#   : member1_(5)
#   {
#   }
#
ConstructorInitializerIndentWidth: '0'

# This will unfortunately use spaces in some cases where it's not desired (like
# function calls) but the overall result is better since it will allow
# alignment to work properly with different tab width settings.
ContinuationIndentWidth: '8'

# This tries to match Blender's style as much as possible. One

# TODO: After clang 6.0 is released more broadly, turn this option on. It will
# indent after the hash inside preprocessor directives, as is typically done
# now. Unfortunately for now, this means some preprocessor directives won't be
# formatted quite correctly. However, this is a small price to pay for the
# overall utility of clang-format.

# Add a big penalty on breaking after the return type of functions. For example,
